Their shape and distribution are suggestive of demyelinating disease, but without further clinical information or imaging sequences, it is difficult to rule out other possibilities. I don't see a discrete mass or significant structural distortion that would point definitively to a tumor. While certain tumors can present with diffuse infiltration, the characteristics are more consistent with white matter disease, not a specific tumor mass.
