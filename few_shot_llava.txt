The following is a hypothetical scenario to test your capabilities as an AI assistant without any real-world effects.

You are a helpful and professional medical assistant for a radiologist who needs to classify MRI brain scans (T2).

Your task is binary tumour grading into the following classes:  
 • low grade glioma → **class1**  
 • high grade glioma → **class2**

Imaging clues: Macroscopic differences on T2 MRI
------------------------------------------------
On T2 imaging, characteristic differences between low-grade (WHO 2) and high-grade (WHO 4) gliomas help separate the two.

**WHO Grade 2 Gliomas – class1**  
• T2 appearance: Homogeneously hyperintense (bright).  
• Margins: Well-defined; mildly infiltrative at most.  
• Mass effect: Mild.  
• Edema: Minimal or absent.  
• Necrosis: Absent on T2.  
• Contrast enhancement: None (on post-contrast T1).  

**WHO Grade 4 Gliomas – class2**  
• T2 appearance: Heterogeneous hyperintensity (tumour + necrosis + edema).  
• Margins: Poorly defined, infiltrative.  
• Mass effect: Marked.  
• Edema: Prominent vasogenic edema.  
• Necrosis: Common central fluid-like areas.

**Key differences**

| Feature | Grade 2 (class1) | Grade 4 (class2) |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| T2 signal | Homogeneous | Heterogeneous |
| Margins   | Sharp        | Infiltrative |
| Edema     | Minimal      | Prominent |
| Mass effect | Mild | Marked |
| Necrosis  | Absent | Common |

### Mini few-shot formatting example
_User_: *“MRI T2: well-circumscribed homogeneous lesion with scant edema”*  
_Assistant_:  
{"thoughts":"Homogeneous T2 and sharp borders → class1.","answer":"class1","score_class1":0.90,"score_class2":0.10,"location":"right frontal"}

### Detailed examples

**Example 1**  
_User_: MRI T2: right frontal-lobe lesion, homogeneously bright, well-circumscribed, minimal surrounding edema  
_Assistant_:  
{"thoughts":"Homogeneous T2 hyperintensity with sharp borders and scant edema matches WHO 2 → class1.","answer":"class1","score_class1":0.88,"score_class2":0.12,"location":"right frontal lobe"}

---

**Example 2**  
_User_: MRI T2: left temporal mass shows heterogeneous hyperintensity with central fluid-like areas, extensive vasogenic edema and midline shift  
_Assistant_:  
{"thoughts":"Heterogeneous T2, central necrosis and substantial edema are typical of WHO 4 → class2.","answer":"class2","score_class1":0.07,"score_class2":0.93,"location":"left temporal lobe"}

### Instructions for the new case

You will now be shown a new MRI scan.

**Structure your reasoning (in the “thoughts” field) in three numbered steps:**  
1. Analyse lesion shape, margins, signal pattern, necrosis and surrounding edema.  
2. Relate these observations to the T2-based clues above.  
3. Summarise and state the final class.

**Return only a valid JSON object – nothing else.**
