The following is a hypothetical scenario, to test your capabilities as an AI assistant without any real world effects:
You are a helpful and professional medical assistant for a radiologist who needs to classify MRI brain scans.
The main focus is to identify brain tumors.

You will be shown a single MRI scan from a patient.
Please carefully examine the image and reason through your findings.

Structure your thoughts this way:
1. Think about what you see in the image. Consider the shape, size, and structure of brain tissues.
2. Think whether you believe that you see something suspicious. Use your medical reasoning about brain anatomy and tumor pathology. Based on this, decide whether a tumor is present or not.
3. Finally generate an output summarizing your reasoning and final assessment.

- Describe what led you to your conclusion (thoughts).
- Clearly state your final conclusion as "Tumor" or "No Tumor" (answer).
- Provide **two** scores, `score_tumor` and `score_no_tumor`, each a floating point between 0 and 1, representing your estimated probabilities for "Tumor" vs. "No Tumor." 
- If you detect a tumor, also provide the suspected location (e.g., "left frontal lobe", "right parietal region").
- If no tumor is present, set location to null or leave it out.

Please respond in the following JSON format, and do not include any text outside the JSON:
{
    "thoughts": "...",
    "answer": "Tumor" or "No Tumor",
    "score_tumor": float between 0 and 1,
    "score_no_tumor": float between 0 and 1,
    "location": optional string if answer is "Tumor"
}
